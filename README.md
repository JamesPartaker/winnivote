# Winni Vote

## Description

Winnivote is a website to submit topics/ideas and vote to show which ones are more popular.

## Goal

Use the development of _Winnivote_ as a common topic for all the participants of the 
[Winnipeg Ruby User Group](http://winnipegrb.org) so each meeetup a volunteer will show a feature or two that has 
been implemented.


## Guidelines

As a learning experience, part of the goal is to use, highlight and learn good coding practices around the RoR world and
programming in general. 

### Practices

* BDD (every feature should have a specification that drives the development)
* TDD (no line of production code is written without a test)
* Branch per feature and then pull request
* Code reviews
* Heroku deployment with staging and production sites
* Continuos Integration


### Tools

* PostgreSQL database
* heroku toolbelt
* Guard
* slim templates
* rSpec for unit and acceptance tests
* Jasmine for JS unit and integration tests
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Knockout.js
* Coffeescript
* Devise
